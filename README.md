# New York City Taxi Project

NYC Taxi Exploration

Data Provided by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. Full dataset is 170 million taxi trips, 100GB of free space. Our subset is 0.5% of all trips, about 850,000 rides.

This exploratory analysis aims to answer the questions like:
Whether the number of passengers affect the fare?
Whether the date and time of pickup affect the fare?
Which vendor is easier to find a cab from?
What is the most common trip distance?
What does the distribution of the fare total amount look like?
What are the distributions of pickup locations and dropoff locations around JFK Airport?
